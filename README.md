# Persian Fake News Detection

This repository contains my dissertation which is Persian fake news detection. To achieve this model, I created a dataset that you can find more information about it from [here](https://github.com/Zarharan/PersianStanceDetection).

## Dataset
I am using the first Persian dataset which can be used for a number of NLP tasks in the context of fact-checking. Although this dataset can be used for fact-checking and summarization, the focus of this work is on stance classification as a stepping stone for fake news detection in Persian language.
